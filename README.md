🔐 AI-Powered Home Security System 🧠🏠
An intelligent home security system that uses YOLOv8 for real-time person detection through a webcam or CCTV. When an unknown person (intruder) is detected, the system:

📸 Captures a snapshot

📧 Sends an email alert with the intruder's photo

📱 (Optional) Sends an SMS alert with GPS location

This project combines computer vision, automation, and AI to simulate a real-world smart security solution.
